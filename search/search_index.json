Multi-channel conversion \u00b6 The ImJoy plugin and FISH-quant requires that each channel is stored as a separate z-stack, if your images are stored as multi-channel z-stacks you can split these channels with FIJI. Create a new folder for each multi-channel image. Open image stack ( .dv ) in FIJI. Split channels (FQ only supports mono-channel input images) a. From menu: Image > Color > Split channels a. Save each channels with a unique channel identifier, e.g. C1- or DAPI_ . RNA detection \u00b6 Detection of RNAs is performed with FISH-quant and detailed here . Annotations of cell membrane \u00b6 In order to be able to compute the enrichment towards cell membrane or nuclear envelope, these membranes have to be annotated in EACH z-slice that should be considered in the analysis. This annotation can either be done manually, or ( TODO ) automatically with segmentation tools . Manual with FIJI \u00b6 Annotations have to be performed and stored as described below. For each multi-channel image, the annotations are stored in a dedicated subfolder called zstack_segmentation . Each annotated z-slice has to be saved as an individual image and the file name has to end with the corresponding z-slice i in the format _Zi . For instance, file name ends with img1_ch3_Z3.tif , where 3 is the actual slice number. You can obtain the individual slices with different methods: FIJI . Open the z-stack and go to menu Image > Stack > Stack to images . You can then save each image with the according file-name. TODO Automatically Annotations are stored with the name of the corresponding image, with the additional suffix __RoiSet.zip . For the example above, the added suffix would be img1_ch3_Z3__RoiSet.zip . To perform the actual annotation, follow these steps Open FIJI. Open the ROI manager : Analyze > Tools > ROI manager Open/Select the image that you would like to annotate. Select the annotation tool of choice, e.g. freehand or polygon. Outline first structure of interest. When done, press Add(t) in the ROI manager to add outline to the out line manager. Proceed with all other structures. Enabling Show all , will show all defined regions. Save regions by highlighting all regions in the list and pressing on More >> Save ... If only one region is saved, this will created a file with the extension .roi , if multiple regions will be save this will create a .zip file. As a file-name choose the name of the annotated image, followed by the suffix **__RoiSet.zip** . IMPORTANT : these annotations could be used for training of a neural network. If this is intended, then ALL structures, e.g. nuclei, have to be annotated. Unwanted elements, e.g. nuclei touching the cell border, can be removed in a post-processing step. Automated with DeepLearning \u00b6 TODO . Analysis with ImJoy \u00b6 The entire functinality of the plugin can be controlled within the plugin window. If you expand the plugin, you will see all parameters and operations that can be performed All options are explained in the Table below. If you change these parameters, the changed values will be saved in the browser and reused the next time you launch ImJoy. Option Type Default Description dZ int 2 Number of z-slices that will be used above and below the currently analyzed slice. Specify this value > 0 if not all z-slices are annotated/ Zmin int 0 Specify at which Z slice analysis should start. Value of 0 means that entire z-stack will be processed. Zmax int 0 As Z min but for maximum Z slice. Channel str 'C3-' Unique identifier for channel containing annotations. Hist [bin] int 20 Bin size for histogram to measure membrane enrichment (in nm). Hist [max] int 100 Maxium value for bins to calculate membrane enrichment. Image-size [X] int 960 Size of image in X. Image-size [Y] int 960 Size of image in Y. To analyze a FQ results file, you have to Specify the required parameters in the plugin interface. Execute plugin with clicking on the Plugin name Membrane Enrichment . This will display a file-dialog where you can select the FQ results file that you want to analyze (ends with __spots.txt ) that should be analyzed. This file will then be processed and the final distance enrichment histogram displayed in the interface. More plots and results file will be stored on the disk. Defining a root folder \u00b6 By default, ImJoy will open files in your home folder. If your data is at a different location, you can set a root folder. Each time you specify a file, ImJoy will open the file-dialog in this root folder. Press the button Root folder and specify the desired folder. The specified root folder is also saved, and will be resused the next time you launch ImJoy. Stored results \u00b6 The analysis script will create a new folder with the same name as the selected results file. In this folder it will create a subfolder MembDist_yymmdd-hhmm containing the analysis results. To allow to redo the analysis with different settings, the pluging will create for each performed analysis a separate folder name with the time-stamp when the analysis was performed (format yymmdd-hhmm ). This folder contains several files: _DistanceEnrichmentSummary.png : image containing the pooled analysis of all slices _HistogramPooled.csv : csv file containing the histograms of the RNA-membrane distance pooled from all z-slices. This can be opened with any Spreadsheet application (Excel, LibreOffice, Numbers, ...) and results from different images can then be pooled together. It contains the following data center : center of the bins histRNA_all : raw RNA distance histogram. histRNA_all_norm : normalized RNA histogram (values add to 1). histpix_all_norm : normalized distance histogram of all pixels in the cell. hist_RNA_all_normPix : normalized RNA histogram with the pixel histogram. Z-i.png : results of slice 'i' DataAll.json : json file containing all analysis results including settings.

Ideally, this curve shows a plateau for a value range corresponding to a good detection threshold. If that\u2019s not the case, a reasonable value corresponding to a visual assessment of what individual RNAs are should be chosen. A pre-detection with a given detection threshold can be perform and the results be inspected in a separate window. One other parameter that could be important to adjust is the **cropping region** around each RNA that is considered for analysis and fitting. Reducing this size allows sometimes to better detect closely spaced RNAs but at the cost of an imprecision in the fit. For most applications a value of +/- 2 voxels in XY and Z are a good compromise. Once you are satisfied with the settings press on Perform detection for all cells to return the main window. Press button Fit to fit each detected spot with a 3D Gaussian function. [Optional]. You can set threshold values for the different fitting parameters, e.g. remove spots with very small or very large standard deviations. You can now save the detection settings: [FQ] Main > Save > Save detection settings . As a file-name specify FQ__settings_MATURE.txt Depending on which analysis you want to perform, you either save the detection results or only the specified cell outline If you are satisfied with these detection results, you can save them directly: [FQ] Main > Save > Save ??? If you would like to also analyze RNA aggregates, you can save only the outline: [FQ] Main > Save > Save ??? Detection of clustered RNAs TODO \u00b6 After performing the steps above you will have two text files (1) the cell outline, (2) FQ detection settings. We provide a Matlab script WRAPPER_analyze_smFISH__EXP_v1.m which detects individual RNAs and then decomposes aggregates into individual RNAs (for more information see our Nat Communications paper ). This script allows batch-processing and multiple images can be analyzed together, where image is processed with its dedicated outline and settings. This can be done with the Matlab script. This script recursively searches a user-defined parental folder for folders containing FQ outline and settings files. These folders will then be processed and RNA detection performed, sub-folders will containing different analysis results will be created. results_GMM contains the RNA detection with the GMM (to decompose foci into individual RNAs). The most important files are the text files ending with _res_GMM.txt containing the RNA detection results, which will be used to perform the co-localization. The folder further contains a subfolder #plots with a PDF showing the results of the GMM detection. Individual RNAs are shown in green, decomposed foci with a red number indicating how many RNAs were estimated to be in each foci. results_noGMM contains the RNA detection results without the GMM.

Inspect image. On the right part of the interface select Filtered image , disable outline , and double click on the image. This will show a maximum intensity projection of the filtered image in a separate window. Here, you can change the contrast and zoom. In order to determine an appropriate threshold in the next step, determine a generous range of intensities range corresponding to the individual RNA molecules. Set pre-detection settings . FQ will test how many RNAs are detected with a range of user-defined intensity thresholds (based on the manual inspection of the image from above). 1. Open dedicated interface: Button Detect 0. In the user-dialog change the first two parameter: minimum and maximum threshold to test. We usually use a minimum value that\u2019s somewhat lower than the lowest RNAs to also consider intensity value corresponding to background. 0.
